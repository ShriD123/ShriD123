### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Shri! I'm a Caltech graduate (Class of 2022) looking to work on projects related to data science, mathematical modelling, simulation, and/or applied AI/ML. 
I'm currently working at Turion Space as a Modeling & Simulations Engineer where I design mission planning tools for low-thrust trajectory optimization and traveling salesman in space. As a project lead at a startup, I work on all aspects of the tool - the algorithms, the infrastructure, the integration, etc.
