### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Shri! I'm a Caltech graduate (Class of 2022) looking to work on projects related to data science, mathematical modelling, simulation, and/oe applied AI/ML. 
----------------------
Blurbs for each Repo:

LangevinSim & Microrheology -- Data Analysis for a Princeton Uni research group; I made these in the summer of 2019.

Algorithms -- Personal practice area for implementing algorithms in various settings. Please refer to this for my most recent coding style / structure. A greater explanation on each of the projects are provided in the ReadME files of this repo.

ME134 & SLAM -- Caltech Robotics Projects I did during my senior year (2022).

----------------------
I'm currently working on other projects that I will add to this repository during 2023!
